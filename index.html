			<h2>About Me:</h2>
			<p >I'm an spiring software engineer that is always eager to learn<br>
			new things and work hard to achieve my goals. I really enjoy working<br>
			with different systems and programs using them to create software<br>
			of my own and to see what I am capable of. Programming<br>
            has continously peeked my interest since learning my first<br>
			"Hello World".</p>
			
			<p>I have worked with a few languages such as Java, Python,<br>
			CSS and HTML. Using these languages I have created programs covering the<br>
			fundamental concepts in programming.</p>
			
			<p>Aside from my love for everything computers I am really fond of the<br>
			outdoors enjoying activities like playing sports (basketball, soccer & touch rugby).<br>
            My hobbies are Gyming, Creatig Content, Art(drawing/painting) and many other things such as movies/music etc</p>
